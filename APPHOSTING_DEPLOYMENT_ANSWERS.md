## **AUTOMATED DEPLOYMENT SCRIPT**

Since Firebase CLI doesn't support non-interactive mode for App Hosting, here's a workaround using expect or yes:

```bash
# Option 1: Using yes for simple Y responses
yes | firebase deploy --only apphosting

# Option 2: Using expect script (if available)
cat > deploy-apphosting.exp << 'EOF'
#!/usr/bin/expect -f
set timeout 300
spawn firebase deploy --only apphosting

# Question 1: Deploy local source?
expect "Are you sure you want to deploy your local source?"
send "Y\r"

# Question 2: Build config
expect "Would you like to use the build configuration"
send "Y\r"

# Question 3: Environment variables
expect "Would you like to set environment variables"
send "n\r"

# Question 4: Secrets access
expect "Grant App Hosting backend access to secrets?"
send "Y\r"

# Question 5: Production
expect "Is this a production deployment?"
send "Y\r"

# Question 6: Auto rollouts
expect "Enable automatic rollouts"
send "n\r"

# Question 7: Traffic migration
expect "Migrate traffic"
send "Y\r"

expect eof
EOF

chmod +x deploy-apphosting.exp
./deploy-apphosting.exp
```

# Option 3: Manual but fast (copy-paste ready)
```

## **ALTERNATIVE: GITHUB PUSH DEPLOYMENT**

If the interactive deployment is problematic, trigger via GitHub:

```bash
# Stage all fixes
git add .
git commit -m "fix: App Hosting production configuration with all optimizations"
git push origin main

# This will trigger App Hosting if connected to GitHub
```

---

## **POST-DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION**

After deployment completes (3-5 minutes), verify:

```bash
# 1. Check health endpoint
curl https://souk-el-sayarat-backend--souk-el-syarat.europe-west4.hosted.app/health

# 2. Check API info
curl https://souk-el-sayarat-backend--souk-el-syarat.europe-west4.hosted.app/api

# 3. Test products endpoint
curl https://souk-el-sayarat-backend--souk-el-syarat.europe-west4.hosted.app/api/products

# 4. Run QA tests
cd qa-automation && node quick-test.js
```
