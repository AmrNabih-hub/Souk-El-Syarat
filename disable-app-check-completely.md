# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Disable Firebase App Check Completely

## The debug token isn't working! We need to disable App Check entirely.

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

#### Step 1: Go to Firebase Console
1. Open: **https://console.firebase.google.com/project/souk-el-syarat**
2. Make sure you're logged in with the correct account

#### Step 2: Navigate to App Check
1. In the left sidebar, click **"App Check"**
2. If you don't see it, look under **"Security"** or **"Build"**

#### Step 3: Find Your Web App
1. You should see a list of your apps
2. Look for your **web app** (it should show as "Web" type)
3. Click on the web app to configure it

#### Step 4: Disable App Check Enforcement
1. Look for **"Enforcement"** or **"Protection"** settings
2. Find the toggle for **"Enforce App Check"**
3. **TURN IT OFF** (toggle should be gray/off)
4. Click **"Save"** or **"Update"**

#### Step 5: Verify the Fix
1. Go back to: **https://souk-el-syarat.web.app/debug-firebase-auth.html**
2. Click **"Test Sign Up"** button
3. You should see **"âœ… Sign up successful!"** instead of the App Check error

### What This Does:
- **Completely disables** Firebase App Check for your web app
- **Removes all restrictions** that were blocking authentication
- **Allows normal Firebase Auth** to work without any tokens

### Alternative Method:
If you can't find the toggle:
1. Look for **"Settings"** in App Check
2. Find **"Enforcement mode"**
3. Set it to **"Unenforced"** or **"Disabled"**
4. Save changes

### Success Indicators:
- âœ… No more `auth/firebase-app-check-token-is-invalid` errors
- âœ… Debug page shows "Sign up successful!"
- âœ… Registration and login work properly
- âœ… No more 401 errors in console

## This is the FINAL fix needed!
