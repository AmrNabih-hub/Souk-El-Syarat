## 🔧 WHAT WAS FIXED

### **The Problem:**
TypeScript was complaining about type mismatches:
- `string` vs `'ar' | 'en'` for language
- `string` vs `'EGP' | 'USD'` for currency

### **The Solution:**
Added proper type casting in all places where preferences are set:

```typescript
preferences: {
  ...userData.preferences,
  language: userData.preferences.language as 'ar' | 'en',
  currency: userData.preferences.currency as 'EGP' | 'USD',
}
```
