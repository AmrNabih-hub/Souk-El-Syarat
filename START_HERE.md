chmod +x setup-appwrite-mcp.sh setup-appwrite-infrastructure.sh
```

### "Appwrite not configured"
```bash
# Re-run setup
bash setup-appwrite-mcp.sh
```

### "Collection not found"

# Re-run infrastructure setup
bash setup-appwrite-infrastructure.sh
```

### Build errors

rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```
