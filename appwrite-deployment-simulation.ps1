🎯 DEPLOYMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

OPTION 1: GitHub Integration (RECOMMENDED)
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Benefits:
✅ Automatic deployments on push
✅ Preview deployments for pull requests  
✅ Rollback capability
✅ CI/CD integration
✅ Version control integration

Steps:
1. Push code to GitHub repository
2. Connect Appwrite Sites to GitHub
3. Configure build settings (npm run build)
4. Set environment variables
5. Deploy automatically on push

OPTION 2: Manual Upload
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Benefits:
✅ Immediate deployment
✅ Full control over deployment timing
✅ Simple process

Steps:
1. Run npm run build locally
2. Upload dist/ folder to Appwrite Sites
3. Configure environment variables
4. Deploy manually

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚠️  IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DATABASE SETUP:
⚠️  Before deploying, ensure Appwrite database collections are created
⚠️  Run the database setup script or create manually in console
⚠️  Verify all collection IDs match environment variables

STORAGE SETUP:
⚠️  Create storage buckets before deploying  
⚠️  Configure proper file permissions
⚠️  Set appropriate file size limits

AUTHENTICATION:
⚠️  Test login/signup flows after deployment
⚠️  Create initial admin user through console
⚠️  Configure session settings

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
⚠️  Double-check all VITE_ prefixed variables are set
⚠️  Ensure no sensitive data in client-side variables
⚠️  Verify endpoint URLs are correct

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🚀 FINAL VERDICT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

$(if ($successRate -ge 90) {
"🎉 READY FOR PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT! 🎉

Your app has passed all simulation tests and is fully prepared for
Appwrite deployment. The migration from AWS to Appwrite is complete
and all systems are compatible.

NEXT STEP: Proceed with actual deployment!"
} elseif ($successRate -ge 75) {
"⚠️  MOSTLY READY - MINOR ISSUES TO ADDRESS

Your app is almost ready for deployment. Please review the failed
tests above and make necessary adjustments before deploying.

NEXT STEP: Fix identified issues, then deploy."

Several critical issues were identified that must be resolved before
deployment. Please address all failed tests and run simulation again.

NEXT STEP: Fix all issues and re-run simulation."
