## 🔧 FIXES JUST DEPLOYED

### Fix 1: Dashboard Link
**Problem**: Clicking "Dashboard" reloaded page  
**Cause**: Link was `/dashboard` but route was `/customer/dashboard`  
**Fix**: Updated Navbar link to `/customer/dashboard`  
**Status**: ✅ Deployed

### Fix 2: 404 Error
**Problem**: Console showed 404 for `todos` table

**Status**: ✅ Deployed
