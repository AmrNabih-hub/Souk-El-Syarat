## **üî¨ REGRESSION TESTING**

### **Critical User Journeys**

#### **Journey 1: New User Registration ‚Üí First Purchase**
```gherkin
Given a new visitor
When they register an account
And browse products
And add item to cart
And complete checkout
Then order should be created
And confirmation email sent
And inventory updated
```

#### **Journey 2: Vendor Product Management**
```gherkin
Given an approved vendor
When they add new product
And set pricing and inventory
And publish listing
Then product appears in marketplace
And analytics track views
And vendor dashboard updates
```

#### **Journey 3: Admin Moderation Flow**
```gherkin
Given pending vendor applications
When admin reviews application
And approves/rejects vendor
Then notification sent to vendor
And status updated in system
And appropriate access granted
```

## **üìä PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS**

### **Load Testing Configuration**
```javascript
// k6 load test script
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check, sleep } from 'k6';

export let options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '2m', target: 100 }, // Ramp up
    { duration: '5m', target: 100 }, // Stay at 100 users
    { duration: '2m', target: 200 }, // Spike to 200
    { duration: '5m', target: 200 }, // Stay at 200
    { duration: '2m', target: 0 },   // Ramp down
  ],
  thresholds: {
    http_req_duration: ['p(95)<500'], // 95% requests under 500ms
    http_req_failed: ['rate<0.1'],    // Error rate under 10%
  },
};
```
