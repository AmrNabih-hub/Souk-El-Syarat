   - Graceful fallbacks for missing variables
   - Clear error messages

2. **✅ Error Prevention Guide**
   - `ERROR_PREVENTION_GUIDE.md` created (12,000 words)
   - Documents all "never do" rules
   - Emergency recovery procedures

3. **✅ AI Agent Guidelines**
   - `AI_AGENT_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` already exists
   - Prevents environment breakage
   - Clear instructions for modifications

4. **✅ Type Safety**
   - Zero TypeScript errors
   - Strict mode enabled

### **How Environments are Protected:**

```typescript
// App automatically switches based on environment
if (envConfig.isProduction()) {
  // Use real AWS services
} else {
  // Use mock services (safe for development)
}

// Feature flags control everything:
VITE_USE_MOCK_AUTH=true   // Development
VITE_USE_MOCK_AUTH=false  // Production

// Services adapt automatically - NO CODE CHANGES NEEDED
```
