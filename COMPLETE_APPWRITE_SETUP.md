## 🎯 DEPLOYMENT STEPS (30 MINUTES)

### Step 1: Create Appwrite Project (5 min)

   - Name: "Setup Script"
   - Scopes: Select ALL (databases.*, storage.*)
   - Copy the API key

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables (2 min)

Create `.env` file in `Souk-El-Syarat/` directory:

```env
# Appwrite Configuration
VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id-here
APPWRITE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# Database
VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=souk-database

# Collections (will be created by script)
VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_USERS=users
VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_PRODUCTS=products
VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ORDERS=orders
