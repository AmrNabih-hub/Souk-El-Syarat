# ✅ VISUAL FIX COMPLETE - UNWANTED BOX REMOVED

## 🎯 **Issue Resolved Successfully**

**Problem:** There was a visible box showing "connect" and other debug information behind the navbar that was interfering with the user interface.

**Solution:** ✅ **FIXED** - The GlobalLiveFeatures component has been completely cleaned up to remove all visible UI elements.

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### ❌ **Before (Problem):**

- Appeared in top-right corner behind/above navbar
- Included elements like:

  - Notifications bell with popup panel
  - Distracting visual elements

### ✅ **After (Fixed):**
